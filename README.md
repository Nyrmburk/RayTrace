# RayTrace
This is a multipurpose ray tracer that supports all kinds of work from 3D physics to offline graphics.

I have taken the liberty to use it for a ray-tracing renderer. It's got support for triangle meshes, textures, piont lights, area lights, and bump mapping (normal mapping).

Shading is well approximated and mostly accurate for most scenarios. The BRDF in use is Cook-Torrance.
